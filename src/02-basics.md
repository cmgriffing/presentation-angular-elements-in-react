## Making A Basic WebComponent

## Lifecycle Callbacks

- connectedCallback: Invoked each time the custom element is appended into a document-connected element. This will happen each time the node is moved, and may happen before the element's contents have been fully parsed.

- disconnectedCallback: Invoked each time the custom element is disconnected from the document's DOM.

- adoptedCallback: Invoked each time the custom element is moved to a new document.

- attributeChangedCallback: Invoked each time one of the custom element's attributes is added, removed, or changed.
